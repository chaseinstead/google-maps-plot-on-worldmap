# google-maps-plot-on-worldmap
visualize paths with google maps location data. work in progress...

to do:
- adjust points' colors depending on altitude of location point
- get rid of outliers
- use more beautiful map
- find out country of each location point and plot high and low points on altitude graph
- mark big cities or points of longer stays (longer than two days?) on world map
