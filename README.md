# google-maps-plot-on-worldmap (work in progress)
visualize paths with location data that google collected.
"map_v2_18_11_23.ipynb" is the main script, and please visit "output examples" for some actual visualizations



currently working on:
- adjusting the points' colors depending on altitude of location point
- automating getting rid of outliers
- adding statistics, e.g. longest distance travelled within 24 hours, etc.
- shortening the code, making it more human-readable

to do:
- find out country of each location point and plot high and low points on the altitude graph
- mark big cities or points of longer stays on world map
